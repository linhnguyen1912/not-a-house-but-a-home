Project title: Not a house but a home
    The user can scroll through the list of furniture, creating them by clicking on the yellow dot on each object,
    the object will then be init in the middle of the screen, where the user can adjust their scale and rotation angle 
    through the up, down, left, right button. The user can delete object by dragging them to the trash can icon/
    The user can index through the shape of the selected furniture. The selected shape will be outline. When the user click return,
    the selectedShape will return to None. I first created this feature for user to know what the selected shape is
    to change the color of this shape but have not been able to complete this feature.
